# Breaking Down Markdown (102 Read 01: Discussion)

## What is "markdown" and why is it so _important_ to coding?
  Markdown is, simply put, a markup language for generating HTML files. Subsequently, markup languages utilize tags to categorize and display content. Markdown uses textual symbols such as # or * to adjust the presentation of content by bolding text, designating text as a headline, or any number of other adjustments. A platform like GitHub utilizes markdown for its primary creative use, and GitHub Pages can subsequently convert that language (while also applying a theme) into a published web page.
  
  Markdown is significantly faster than coding directly with a language like HTML. This speed, however, can sometimes compromise the detail control that HTML can offer. Additionally, markdon is significantly different that a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) program, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. These programs offer direct feedback on a project and many "drag-and-drop" features that make them user friendly, but subsequently lose much of the control that markdown can offer.
  
  An example of markdown:
  
  *This text will be italic* (This text utilized * on either end of the complete sentence)

_This will also be italic_ (This text utilized _ on either end of the complete sentence)

**This text will be bold** (This text utilized ** on either end of the complete sentence)

__This will also be bold__ (This text utilized __ on either end of the complete sentence)

_You **can** combine them_ (This text utilized _ on either end of the complete sentence, but also included ** on either end of the work "can")
