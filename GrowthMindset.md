# Growth Mindset

## Three reminders for retaining a growth mindset:

1. Don't compare your progress to anyone else's. This is _your_ coding journey.
  Comparing yourself to someone else, and often feel threatened by them, is indicative of a **fixed mindset**.
  Finding ways to be inspired by others and their work, and seeking outways to work collaboratively, is indicative
  of a **Growth Mindset**.
  
2. Acknowledge challenges and obstacles for what they are.
  When you come across an immovable wall of an obstacle in your coding journey, keep the following steps in mind:
  - [ ] Recognize and acknowledge what the issue is.
  - [ ] Take a step back and reset your brain with a different task.
  - [ ] Return to your project and tackle something different, if possible.
  - [ ] When inspired, return to face the original challenge with refreshed eyes and renewed motivation.
  
3. Continue to reassess and reevaluate with self-critique.
  Make an effort to do a daily check-in and evaluation of your work. Don't be afraid of criticism - it allows you to
  continue to grow and be the best **YOU** that you can be!
