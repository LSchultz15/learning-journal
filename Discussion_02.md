**What is the Terminal?**
  The Terminal is a CLI, or Command Line Interface, for MacOS. A Command Line Interface, simply put, is a text-based system utilized to manage files - and _everything_ is made up of files. Utilizing a large variety of extensions, add-ons, and command codes (such as cd (Change Directory) or mkdir (Make Directory)), one can complete just about any task the typical File Explorer interface on the MacOS can do...and much more. In fact, these tasks directly align with File Explorer interactions you've probably already had - building new folders, copying and moving files, deleting folders and files, etc.

    `Terminal Code Examples:
      cd= Change Directory
      ls= List
      pwd= Print Working Directory (Display Current Location)
      mkdir= Make Directory
      touch= Create File
      Code .= Open Default Code Editor For Current Directory Location`
  
**What is a Text Editor?**
  You're certainly familiar with Text Editors already: MS Word, Google Docs, Notepad, Text Edit, etc. These are tools that can input, analyze, adjust, and output text to meet a specific need. 

**What is a Code Editor?**
  A Code Editor is not largely dissimilar to a Text Editor, such as MS Word or Google Docs, but serves the specific function of editing code, which means that it comes with unique additional functions. Though there are multiple types of Code Editors, many also serves as an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. These "beefed-up" interfaces allow for numerous additional functions and extensions, and offer ways to analyze, debug, and even publish the code being edited.

**How Do I Choose Which Program to Use?**
  There are numerous programs out there that, at the end of the day, are able to "get the job done." There's no question that MS Word is a valuable tool to many for creating documents and handouts. I, personally, am already falling in love with VS Code (the autofill technology makes my experience with DeltaV Code School 101 look like the caveman times). But at the end of it all, you should utilize the program that you feel comfortable with and that offers you the functionality that helps you succeed in your project.
